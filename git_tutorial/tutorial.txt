Setup your git credentials: 


The first time you enter your username and password to clone a repo, it will be saved to the git-config file
git config --global credential.helper store 

------------------------------------------------------

To clone a repository:

1. Go to file folder where you want the repo to exist 
2. git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo> (remove <>, replace with your username and brackets)

-------------------------------------------------------

To make sure you don't need to always put in the repo_link when you want to pull: 

git remote add variable_name https://<your_username>/<your_repo>

After you add a remote, say you called it test, you can pull from git using the following: 

git pull test <branch> 

In the place of branch, you would just put the name of the branch you want. For example, say you want to pull everything in the repo: 

git pull test main --> usually main will be the overarching name for the repo, but you can check by goint to the repo on github.com 

------------------------------------------------------

Pushing to git: 

go to your local repository, then run the following lines in terminal:

git add .

git commit -m "your_comment_here"

git push variable_name branch_name 

When you try to push to git, it will ask for your username and password, you can type in your username, but your git password is no longer accepted as a method for command line pushing. You need to create a key:

-----------------------------------------------------------

Creating a key in git:

1. go to github.com and login 
2. go to settings --> developer options 
3. personal access tokens 
4. make one, and copy down the password it gives you. You will need it when typing in your password to push
5. Remember! We added in a global identifier, so the password will be saved for use
